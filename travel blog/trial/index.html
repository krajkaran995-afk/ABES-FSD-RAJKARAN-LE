            Visual records from the Chinese Warring States period (475–221 bce) indicate that bells in various and progressively larger sizes were suspended from a horizontal beam or pole. These were struck to produce a scale of tones. More than 400 indigenously produced dōtaku have been discovered in Japan. These bells range from 4 to 50 inches in height. Their quality suggests a rather advanced state of technical acumen
